01. How to classify for 3 or more variables using logistic regression?
02. Tradeoff between increasing specificity and sensitivity vs overall acuracy?
03. How to do linear regression that has bounded values or integer outputs only?
04. Is there any concrete way to show that a variable does not affect the outcome so it can be ignored?
05. Should we remove all variables with near zero variance from the predictor?
06. How regular supervised learning can perform piecewise defined function abilities, or should neural network be used?
07. Is there anyway to determine linear/radial/etc kernel, or we just have to do trial and error?
numeric & integer svc

Variable with near zero variance, should we remove? correlatioin linear line m = 0, should we remove?
