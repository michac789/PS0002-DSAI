--- 01. Introduction To Machine Learning ---
- Training Data: used to train the data
- Testing Data: used to evaluate machine learning methods
- How to assess if a machine learning model does well?
Able to make the best predictions from the testing data

--- 02. Cross Validation ---
1) Training
2) Testing
> Resampling methods that use different portions of the data to train
and test the model on different iterations
- Prevents overfitting or selection bias, how model generalize

--- 03. Confusion Matrix ---
Rows: predicted, Columns: known truth
Example for 2 different options:
* True Positives, False Positives
* False Negatives, True Negatives
Matrix has dimension: k x k, where
k: number of options to choose from

--- 04. Sensitivity & Specificity ---
Sensitivity = True Positives / True Positives + False Negatives
Specificity = True Negatives / True Negatives + False Positives
Sensitivity (True Positive Rate), Specificity (True Negative Rate)
False Positive Rate = 1 - Specificity = False P / False P + True P
False Negative Rate = 1 - Sensitivity = False N / False N + True N

--- 05. Bias & Variance ---
Bias: inability of machine learning method to capture true relationship
Variance: difference in fits between data sets
*Prevent overfitting & underfitting
A good model should minimize bias and variance (tradeoff)
higher bias = lower variance, lower bias = high variance

--- 06. ROC & AUC ---
- Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC):
show graph of sensitivity (y-axis) against false positve rate
summarises all of the confusion matrix that each threshold produced
- Area Under Curve (AUC):
Compare between methods; larger area means better predictions
