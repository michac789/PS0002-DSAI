# PS0002 DSAI

This repository is loosely based on the module PS0002 Introduction to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence using R. It contains plenty of codes including R Basics, data visualization, machine learning techniques, various mini projects including final project. This repository will still undergo some changes in the future as currently, there are still some incomplete material.

## [Project](project)

Overview: Grading an attacking playerâ€™s performance in a football match based on 2590 observations and 33 variables from FBRef.com, performing EDA, visualizing graphs, creating regression, classification, and clustering model & analyzing the results

Due to security (and perhaps infringement) issue, I am not posting the final report in public as it was a collaborative work and was submitted for grading purpose in the course. The link above will only contain the dataset and the code that I created.
